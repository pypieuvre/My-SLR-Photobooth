This is my personal set up, used to run this program :

- A **Laptop** running the program (can be any desktop, raspberry, etc ....)

- A **screen** used by the laptop to show preview, countdown, and photo

- A **SLR Camera** (Old Canon 500D without preview screen)

- A **remote control** to trigger photoshoot

 

 

### Features :

- Preview with Laptop or external webcam

- Shooting triggered from keyboard or remote control

- Countdown to let people get ready

- Taking picture from the SLR Camera (or a webcam)

## Product Improvement
Several additional features can be implemented to make this photobooth better. Here are a few ideas of stories to be implemented :
- With compatible SLR, use preview from camera instead of webcam
- use Text overlay instead of images for countdown
- send photo to emails
